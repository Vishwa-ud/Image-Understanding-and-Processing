# 📷 Image Understanding and Processing with OpenCV-Python

## 🚀 Introduction
This repository provides an introduction to image processing and understanding using **OpenCV** with **Python**. OpenCV is an open-source computer vision library that allows for real-time image and video processing, making it widely used in fields such as **robotics, AI, and medical imaging**.

## 🔧 Prerequisites
Ensure you have **Python** installed on your system before proceeding. It is recommended to use **Python 3.6 or later**.

## 📥 Installation
To set up your environment, install the required dependencies using **pip**:

```bash
pip install opencv-python
pip install matplotlib
python -m pip install jupyter
```

## ▶️ Running Jupyter Notebook
To start working with Jupyter Notebook, run the following command:

```bash
python -m notebook
```

This will open **Jupyter Notebook** in your web browser, allowing you to execute and visualize **OpenCV-based image processing** scripts. 

## ⌨️ Jupyter Notebook Shortcuts
